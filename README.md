CMDB API Server

The inventory CMDB started as way to track assets and some parts of configuration of these assets, and evolved (for better or for worse) to be able to manage and track non-physical assets (VMs, VIPs, etc...) and also to manage non-system configuration (service, cluster instance, etc...)

It is now a part of a larger set of loosely coupled Operations tools that we collectively refer to as NOMS:
